# ALX Listing App

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page

Project Structure
This project's structure is made up of components and directories to establish the project foundation through directories and files that include: 
components/common/Card.tsx: This file will define a reusable Card component that will be used across the project to display information about various properties.

components/common/Button.tsx: This file will define a reusable Button component, which will be used for actions like “Book Now,” “Details,” etc.

interfaces/index.ts: Define all TypeScript interfaces related to the project. Start by creating placeholder interfaces for CardProps and ButtonProps.

constants/index.ts: Set up constants to store any reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text# alx-listing-app-00
